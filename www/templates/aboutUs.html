      <p style="font-size:16px;text-indent:15px; text-align:justify;" class="padding-left padding-right">As part of the largest volunteer child advocacy association in the nation, Nevada Parent Teacher Association (Nevada PTA) reminds our state of its obligations to children and provides parents and families with a powerful voice to speak on behalf of every child while providing the best tools for parents to help their children be successful students.</p>
      <p style="font-size:16px;text-indent:15px; text-align:justify;" class="padding-left padding-right">Nevada PTA does not act alone. Working in cooperation with National PTA and many state and national education, health, safety, and child advocacy groups and state and federal agencies, Nevada PTA collaborates on projects that benefit children and that bring valuable resources to its members. The Parent Teacher Association Membership is open to anyone who believes in the Mission and Purposes of The Parent Teacher Association.</p>
      <p style="font-size:16px;text-indent:15px; text-align:justify;" class="padding-left padding-right">Individual members may belong to any number of PTAs and pay dues in each. Every person who joins a local PTA automatically becomes a member of both the state and National PTAs. Together we are a powerful voice for children. With your help, we can continue to work toward PTAâ€™s goal of a quality education and nurturing environment for every child.</p>
      <p style="font-size:16px;text-indent:15px; text-align:justify;" class="padding-left padding-right">Our association was created in 1941 as a constituency of the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to promote closer cooperation among parents, teachers, educators and members of the community, who work in large and small ways to secure a nurturing, healthy environment for children. We meet a variety of needs through our programs and projects ranging from providing children with basic school materials to providing input at the state level regarding new legislation affecting the children of Nevada.</p>
