        <p style="font-size:16px;text-indent:15px; text-align:justify;" class="padding-left padding-right">The goal for National PTAs Healthy Lifestyles programming is to help school and home environments make the healthy choice the easy choice. Nearly one in three children in America are overweight or obese. Obesity has potentially devastating consequences for youth, increasing the risk of health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Children who are obese also miss more school than other kids. If we don’t reverse the current childhood obesity trend, this will be the first generation to live sicker and die younger than their parents. PTA has an important role to play in reversing this trend. Problems exist both at home and school that could benefit from a stronger family-school partnership around advocacy, mobilization and family education—PTAs specific niche. The Healthy Lifestyles program provides family-centered education and tools to empower families to partner with schools and advocate for healthy changes around nutrition and physical activity, and create an environment at home that supports the positive changes happening at school. By advocating for nutritious school meals and quality physical education, ensuring healthy options are available at home, and modeling healthy behaviors, parents can create lifelong healthy habits within their families and school communities and foster their children’s academic, social, emotional and physical growth.</p>
